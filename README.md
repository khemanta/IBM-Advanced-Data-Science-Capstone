# Capital Bikeshare Rental Demand Forecast 

### The Capstone Project for IBM Advanced Data Science Specialization Certification by Coursera

<hr>

### Abstract
In this project, I have build a neural network model and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more.

### Objective 

The objective of this project is to build a model to forecast the total number of bike rentals for 3 months
for every hour. You are provided hourly rental data spanning for 21 months. The core data set is related
to the two year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bike-share system,
Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data . The
corresponding weather and seasonal information is extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.

## Motivation for The Case Study
A lot of startup company flourished and mushroomed to name a few: OBike, MoBike, OFO, etc are prominent few in Singapore and South East Asia. So are many in other parts of the world. But recently OBike has to pull out of business from Singapore and Australia and so other players have been facing economic viability and challenges of monetization for those who have sustained business to some extent. It was sign of bankruptcy as the business model has not succeeded as far the economic promises it has done. What could be the reason? We in this project case study try to understand if pricing, weather, or any other factor like availability of bikes in the area of demand is constantly met.

What observation and as first hand user experience of shared bike, I can safely assume the hypothesis
of pricing not a factor as it is cheapest. What is left is availability at the demand site (places) in adequate
numbers. This could be interesting to investigate using descriptive statistics to begin with and then we
aim to formulate the right hypothesis to be tested and if possible use predictive analytics to help in that
scenario.
